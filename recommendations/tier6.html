                <h2>Physically Isolated Computer for Sensitive Activities</h2>
                <p>Using a dedicated, physically isolated computer for your most sensitive activities helps minimize the risk of data leaks and malware infections from your everyday computing devices.</p>
                <p>When setting up a physically isolated computer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a separate, dedicated machine that is not connected to the internet or any networks.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the computer has no wireless connectivity capabilities, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</li>
                    <li>Use a fresh, clean installation of a secure operating system, such as <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" target="_blank">Tails</a> or <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank">Qubes OS</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reserve this isolated computer for only the most sensitive tasks, such as working with confidential documents, managing cryptographic keys, or accessing highly secure systems.</p>
