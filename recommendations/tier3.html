                    <li><a href="https://nordvpn.com/" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> - A highly reputable VPN service known for its advanced security features, fast speeds, and extensive server network.</li>

                <h2>Privacy-focused Search Engines</h2>
                <p>These search engines prioritize user privacy by not tracking or profiling users, and they do not store search history or personal information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> - A privacy-focused search engine that does not track users or personalize search results.</li>

                </ul>
