                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Ford Scott, a dedicated student at Washington and Lee University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Digital Culture and Information. This project is a fusion of my academic pursuits and personal passion for online privacy and digital security. I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute positively to the digital world, ensuring that people can protect their online identities and data.</p>

                <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
                <p>To create the metaphorical visual examples that bring this project to life, I utilized OpenAI's DALL-E 4, a cutting-edge AI that generates stunning, bespoke images based on textual descriptions. This technology has allowed us to visually represent the abstract concepts of online privacy and security in an engaging and relatable way.</p>
                <p>For crafting the metaphorical text examples that simplify complex ideas, I turned to Claude Opus 3.0. This powerful language model has been instrumental in translating technical jargon into accessible, easy-to-understand metaphors that resonate with our audience.</p>
