        <h1>Tor Network</h1>
        <p>Tor, short for "The Onion Router," is a free, open-source software and network that helps users defend against internet surveillance and traffic analysis. When you connect to the internet through Tor, your internet traffic is routed through a network of servers (called nodes or relays) operated by volunteers all around the world, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace your online activities back to you.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works: when you connect to Tor, your internet traffic is first encrypted multiple times. Then, it's routed through a random series of Tor nodes. Each node only knows the location of the immediately preceding and following nodes, not the full path that the data has taken or will take. At each node, one layer of encryption is removed (like peeling an onion, hence the name), revealing the next destination. The final node (called the exit node) decrypts the final layer and sends the data to its ultimate destination.</p>
        <p>This process makes it incredibly difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to its original source. Even if someone is monitoring one of the nodes, they can't see the full path of the data. This provides a high level of anonymity for the user.</p>
        <p>Tor is commonly used by journalists, activists, and whistleblowers who need to communicate securely and avoid censorship. It's also a critical tool for people living under oppressive regimes where internet access is restricted or monitored.</p>
        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>While Tor is an essential tool for privacy and free speech, it can also be used for nefarious purposes. The anonymity provided by Tor makes it possible for people to access the dark web and engage in illegal activities like drug trafficking or the spread of child abuse imagery. There are also concerns about the security of exit nodes - a malicious exit node could potentially spy on traffic passing through it. Additionally, using Tor can significantly slow down your internet speed and may limit your access to certain services. Some websites block traffic from known Tor nodes to prevent abuse.</p>
