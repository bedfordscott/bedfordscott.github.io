            <h1>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h1>
            <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password.</p>

            <h2>Metaphorical Example</h2>
            <p>2FA is like having a second layer of security to protect your digital castle. In addition to your password (the first layer), you need a special code (the second layer) to prove it's really you trying to enter. It's similar to showing both your ID and a secret handshake to gain access to an exclusive club.</p>

            <p>Common 2FA methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SMS or Email Codes:</strong> A unique code is sent to your phone or email, which you must enter along with your password to log in.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticator Apps:</strong> Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy generate time-based codes that you use to verify your identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware Security Keys:</strong> Physical devices, such as YubiKeys, that you plug into your computer or pair with your phone to authenticate your login.</li>
                <li><strong>Biometric Data:</strong> Some systems use fingerprints, facial recognition, or other biometric data as a second factor.</li>
            </ul>
