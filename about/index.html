                <h1>About This Project</h1>
                <p>This project is driven by a singular mission: to make online privacy and security understandable and accessible to everyone. By using clear language, engaging metaphors, and vivid metaphorical visual examples, we aim to demystify the complex world of online privacy and provide practical steps and a central hub for anyone seeking to enhance their digital security.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools necessary to protect their digital presence, ensuring they can navigate the internet safely and confidently.</p>

                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Ford Scott, a third-year student at Washington and Lee University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Digital Culture and Information. This project is a fusion of my academic pursuits and personal passion for online privacy and digital security. I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute positively to the digital world, ensuring that people can protect their online identities and data.</p>

                <h2>Technical Documentation</h2>
                <p>To create the metaphorical visual examples that bring this project to life, I utilized OpenAI's DALL-E 4, a cutting-edge AI that generates stunning, bespoke images based on textual descriptions. This technology has allowed us to visually represent the abstract concepts of online privacy and security in an engaging and relatable way.</p>
                <p>For crafting the metaphorical text examples that simplify complex ideas, I turned to Claude Opus 3.0. This powerful language model has been instrumental in translating technical jargon into accessible, easy-to-understand metaphors that resonate with our audience.</p>
                <p>In developing this website, I prioritized security and simplicity by coding everything by hand. This project is built using only raw HTML and CSS, with a deliberate decision to avoid JavaScript. This approach minimizes the site's attack surface and reduces potential vulnerabilities that could compromise user privacy and security. I chose not to use any templates or pre-defined HTML and CSS structures. Instead, I embraced the challenge of learning front-end development from the ground up during the course of this project. My aim was to create a website that is not only informative and user-friendly but also exemplifies the principles of online security it advocates.</p>
