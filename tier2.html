                <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
                <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password.</p>
                <p>Common 2FA methods include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SMS or email codes</li>
                    <li>Authenticator apps like <a href="https://authy.com/" target="_blank">Authy</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/" target="_blank">Google Authenticator</a></li>
                    <li>Hardware security keys like <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank">YubiKey</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Enable 2FA on your most important accounts, such as email, banking, and social media, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
