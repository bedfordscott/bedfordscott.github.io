            <h1>Privacy-Focused Search Engines</h1>
            <p>Privacy-focused search engines like DuckDuckGo and Startpage prioritize user privacy by not tracking or profiling users.</p>

            <h2>Metaphorical Example</h2>
            <p>Privacy-focused search engines are like a discreet librarian who helps you find the information you need without keeping a record of your requests. Unlike other search engines that track your searches to build a profile of your interests, these search engines delete your search history and don't use your data for advertising purposes.</p>

            <p>Key features of privacy-focused search engines include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> These search engines do not track your IP address, search history, or other personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> They use encryption to protect your search queries from being intercepted by third parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Search:</strong> Your searches are not linked to your identity, preventing search engines from building a profile of your interests.</li>
                <li><strong>No Targeted Advertising:</strong> Privacy-focused search engines do not use your search data to show you targeted ads, unlike many mainstream search engines.</li>
            </ul>
